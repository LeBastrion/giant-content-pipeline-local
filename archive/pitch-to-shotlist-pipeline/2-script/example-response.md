THE NEST - DAY\n\nSunlight filters through the chandelier crystals, casting rainbow patterns across button chairs and petal tables. KIDDO tumbles through the sparkling entrance, wings fluttering wildly, clutching a MASSIVE PURPLE CRAYON STUB like a trophy.\n\nKIDDO\nFound it! The magic disappearing wand!\n\nSPARKLES bounces up from her hammock, pink wings shimmering with excitement.\n\nSPARKLES\nA disappearing wand? Let me see, let me see!\n\nBLOSSOM adjusts her glasses, pulling out her magical notebook filled with sketches of human objects.\n\nBLOSSOM\nHold on—where exactly did you find this?\n\nKIDDO\nLucy's art table! She used it and POOF—her yellow crayon vanished!\n\nFrom below, LUCY'S MOM's voice drifts up through the floorboards.\n\nLUCY'S MOM (O.S.)\nLucy, honey, where did your yellow crayon go?\n\nThe three fairies flutter to their telescope (made from a paper towel tube) and peer down. Lucy sits at her art table, shoulders slumped, staring at an unfinished rainbow missing its sun.\n\nSPARKLES\nOh no! She can't finish her rainbow!\n\nKIDDO\nShould I wave the wand and make it reappear?\n\nKiddo waves the purple crayon dramatically. Fairy dust swirls everywhere, making Blossom sneeze.\n\nBLOSSOM\nWait wait wait! Let me measure this first.\n\nShe holds up the crayon against her notebook drawings, comparing sizes and shapes.\n\nBLOSSOM (CONT'D)\nAccording to my notes, this matches a \"coloring stick\"...\n\nSPARKLES\nWe don't have time for notes! Lucy needs her sunshine-maker!\n\nKIDDO\nBut what if I accidentally disappear something else?\n\nBLOSSOM\nGood point. Let's investigate properly.\n\nINT. LUCY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe three fairies spiral down from the chandelier, landing softly on Lucy's art table between scattered papers and crayon boxes.\n\nSPARKLES\nOkay, show us exactly what happened.\n\nKIDDO\nLucy was coloring here, then put the yellow down, used the purple—\n\nKiddo demonstrates, accidentally drawing a purple streak across the paper.\n\nKIDDO (CONT'D)\nWhoa! It's leaving a trail!\n\nBLOSSOM\nFascinating! It doesn't make things disappear—it makes things appear!\n\nSPARKLES\nLook! Yellow marks!\n\nShe points to waxy yellow streaks leading off the table, down the leg, across the carpet.\n\nKIDDO\nIt's like a treasure map!\n\nThe fairies follow the yellow trail, fluttering low along the floor.\n\nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe yellow streaks lead under the massive refrigerator. The fairies peer into the darkness.\n\nSPARKLES\nToo dark under there. Next clue!\n\nBLOSSOM\nThe trail continues this way!\n\nThey zoom around the corner, following more yellow marks.\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe trail leads behind the couch. Kiddo squeezes into the dusty space.\n\nKIDDO\nJust dust bunnies and... wait, more yellow streaks!\n\nSPARKLES\nGoing up!\n\nThe marks climb mysteriously up the curtains. The fairies flutter higher, following the waxy path.\n\nBLOSSOM\nHow did it get up here?\n\nA soft MEOW answers her question. MUFFIN the cat sits on the bookshelf, tail swishing, watching them with knowing eyes.\n\nKIDDO\nMuffin! Did you take the crayon?\n\nMuffin blinks slowly, then paws at something yellow wedged behind books on the top shelf.\n\nSPARKLES\nThere it is! Way up there!\n\nBLOSSOM\nThat's too high, even for our wings.\n\nKIDDO\nNot if we work together!\n\nThe three fairies form a wobbly flying tower—Sparkles at the bottom, Blossom in the middle, Kiddo stretching up top.\n\nSPARKLES\nStop wiggling!\n\nBLOSSOM\nYou're the one wiggling!\n\nKIDDO\nAlmost... got it!\n\nKiddo's tiny fingers nudge the crayon. It rolls slowly toward the edge.\n\nKIDDO (CONT'D)\nJust... a little... more!\n\nThe crayon teeters on the shelf edge. The fairy tower wobbles dangerously.\n\nSPARKLES\nWe're gonna fall!\n\nBLOSSOM\nHold steady!\n\nThe crayon drops. The fairies tumble apart, wings fluttering frantically as they watch it fall... fall... fall...\n\nTHUNK! It lands perfectly in Lucy's art supply box.\n\nKIDDO\nWe did it!\n\nAll three fairies' wings GLOW extra bright, showering sparkles everywhere.\n\nINT. LUCY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nLucy walks to her art table, picks up the box, and gasps with delight.\n\nLUCY (O.S.)\nMy yellow! It was here all along!\n\nShe immediately starts coloring the biggest, brightest sun on her rainbow. The fairies hover nearby, beaming with pride.\n\nSPARKLES\nLook how happy she is!\n\nBLOSSOM\nThe crayon didn't disappear—it just went on an adventure.\n\nKIDDO\nThe real magic isn't making things disappear...\n\nSPARKLES\nIt's helping them reappear right when someone needs them!\n\nBLOSSOM\nThat's definitely going in my notebook.\n\nThe three fairies flutter back toward the chandelier as Lucy hums happily below, her rainbow complete with its glorious yellow sun.\n\nFADE OUT.\n```"
