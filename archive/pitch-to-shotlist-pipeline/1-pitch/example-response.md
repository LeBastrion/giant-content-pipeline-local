The fairies try everything: pushing clock hands forward (which just breaks the clock), making lunch disappear faster (by hiding sandwich pieces around the house), and even attempting to cast a \"hurry-up spell\" using Lucy's bubble wand, which only creates a spectacular mess of soap bubbles that nearly reveals their existence when Muffin starts batting at them. As their increasingly frantic attempts to eliminate waiting time create more chaos—and actually make lunch take longer as Lucy's mom searches for the missing sandwich pieces—Blossom discovers Lucy's egg timer and becomes fascinated by how it measures waiting, while Sparkles races around trying to make everything in the house go faster, from spinning the ceiling fan to fast-forwarding Lucy's mom's music. When Kiddo finally sits down and starts building a tower with blocks to pass the time, showing the fairies how doing something gentle makes waiting easier, Sparkles and Blossom realize they've been thinking about patience all wrong—it's not about making time go faster, but about finding peaceful things to do while time passes on its own, and soon all three are working together to create the most elaborate block castle ever, making the waiting time feel magical instead of endless, until suddenly Lucy's mom announces lunch is over and it's puzzle time, leaving everyone amazed at how quickly the time passed when they stopped fighting against it.\n```"
