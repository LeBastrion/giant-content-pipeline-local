THE NEST - DAY\n\nSunlight filters through the chandelier crystals, casting rainbow patterns across button chairs and petal tables. KIDDO tumbles through the sparkling entrance, wings fluttering wildly, clutching a MASSIVE PURPLE CRAYON STUB like a trophy.\n\nKIDDO\n[breathless, excited] Found it! The magic disappearing wand!\n\nSPARKLES bounces up from her hammock, pink wings shimmering with excitement. {{SFX: soft fabric rustling, fairy wings chiming}}\n\nSPARKLES\n[gasps] A disappearing wand? Let me see, let me SEE!\n\nBLOSSOM adjusts her glasses, pulling out her magical notebook filled with sketches of human objects. {{SFX: pages fluttering softly}}\n\nBLOSSOM\n[cautious] Hold on—where exactly did you find this?\n\nKIDDO\n[proud] Lucy's art table! She used it and POOF—her yellow crayon vanished!\n\nFrom below, LUCY'S MOM's voice drifts up through the floorboards. {{SFX: muffled footsteps from below}}\n\nLUCY'S MOM (O.S.)\n[distant, muffled] Lucy, honey, where did your yellow crayon go?\n\nThe three fairies flutter to their telescope (made from a paper towel tube) and peer down. {{SFX: tiny wings buzzing}} Lucy sits at her art table, shoulders slumped, staring at an unfinished rainbow missing its sun.\n\nSPARKLES\n[concerned] Oh no! She can't finish her rainbow!\n\nKIDDO\nShould I wave the wand and make it reappear?\n\nKiddo waves the purple crayon dramatically. Fairy dust swirls everywhere, making Blossom sneeze. {{SFX: magical sparkles tinkling}}\n\nBLOSSOM\n[sneezes] Wait wait WAIT! Let me measure this first.\n\nShe holds up the crayon against her notebook drawings, comparing sizes and shapes.\n\nBLOSSOM (CONT'D)\n[thoughtful] According to my notes, this matches a \"coloring stick\"...\n\nSPARKLES\n[impatient] We don't have time for notes! Lucy needs her sunshine-maker!\n\nKIDDO\n[worried] But what if I accidentally disappear something else?\n\nBLOSSOM\nGood point. Let's investigate properly.\n\nINT. LUCY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe three fairies spiral down from the chandelier, landing softly on Lucy's art table between scattered papers and crayon boxes. {{SFX: gentle fairy landing, papers rustling}}\n\nSPARKLES\nOkay, show us EXACTLY what happened.\n\nKIDDO\nLucy was coloring here, then put the yellow down, used the purple—\n\nKiddo demonstrates, accidentally drawing a purple streak across the paper. {{SFX: waxy crayon on paper}}\n\nKIDDO (CONT'D)\n[surprised] Whoa! It's leaving a trail!\n\nBLOSSOM\n[excited realization] Fascinating! It doesn't make things disappear—it makes things APPEAR!\n\nSPARKLES\n[gasps] Look! Yellow marks!\n\nShe points to waxy yellow streaks leading off the table, down the leg, across the carpet.\n\nKIDDO\nIt's like a treasure map!\n\nThe fairies follow the yellow trail, fluttering low along the floor. {{SFX: soft wing beats following trail}}\n\nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe yellow streaks lead under the massive refrigerator. The fairies peer into the darkness. {{SFX: refrigerator humming softly}}\n\nSPARKLES\n[dismissive] Too dark under there. Next clue!\n\nBLOSSOM\nThe trail continues this way!\n\nThey zoom around the corner, following more yellow marks. {{SFX: quick fairy flight whoosh}}\n\nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe trail leads behind the couch. Kiddo squeezes into the dusty space. {{SFX: fabric shifting}}\n\nKIDDO\n[muffled] Just dust bunnies and... wait, more yellow streaks!\n\nSPARKLES\n[excited] Going UP!\n\nThe marks climb mysteriously up the curtains. The fairies flutter higher, following the waxy path. {{SFX: curtain fabric rustling}}\n\nBLOSSOM\n[puzzled] How did it get up here?\n\nA soft MEOW answers her question. {{SFX: cat meowing knowingly}} MUFFIN the cat sits on the bookshelf, tail swishing, watching them with knowing eyes.\n\nKIDDO\nMuffin! Did YOU take the crayon?\n\nMuffin blinks slowly, then paws at something yellow wedged behind books on the top shelf. {{SFX: soft paw tapping}}\n\nSPARKLES\n[triumphant] There it is! Way up there!\n\nBLOSSOM\n[sighs] That's too high, even for our wings.\n\nKIDDO\n[determined] Not if we work together!\n\nThe three fairies form a wobbly flying tower—Sparkles at the bottom, Blossom in the middle, Kiddo stretching up top. {{SFX: wings buzzing with effort}}\n\nSPARKLES\n[straining] Stop wiggling!\n\nBLOSSOM\n[wobbling] YOU'RE the one wiggling!\n\nKIDDO\n[reaching] Almost... got it!\n\nKiddo's tiny fingers nudge the crayon. It rolls slowly toward the edge. {{SFX: crayon rolling on wood}}\n\nKIDDO (CONT'D)\n[straining] Just... a little... MORE!\n\nThe crayon teeters on the shelf edge. The fairy tower wobbles dangerously.\n\nSPARKLES\n[panicked] We're gonna fall!\n\nBLOSSOM\n[urgent] Hold steady!\n\nThe crayon drops. The fairies tumble apart, wings fluttering frantically as they watch it fall... fall... fall... {{SFX: wings fluttering frantically}}\n\nTHUNK! {{SFX: crayon landing in plastic box}} It lands perfectly in Lucy's art supply box.\n\nKIDDO\n[breathless, joyful] We did it!\n\nAll three fairies' wings GLOW extra bright, showering sparkles everywhere. {{SFX: magical chimes and sparkles cascading}}\n\nINT. LUCY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nLucy walks to her art table, picks up the box, and gasps with delight. {{SFX: footsteps approaching, box rattling}}\n\nLUCY (O.S.)\n[delighted, distant] My yellow! It was here all along!\n\nShe immediately starts coloring the biggest, brightest sun on her rainbow. {{SFX: crayon coloring enthusiastically}} The fairies hover nearby, beaming with pride.\n\nSPARKLES\n[warm] Look how happy she is!\n\nBLOSSOM\n[thoughtful] The crayon didn't disappear—it just went on an adventure.\n\nKIDDO\n[realizing] The real magic isn't making things disappear...\n\nSPARKLES\n[gentle] It's helping them reappear right when someone needs them!\n\nBLOSSOM\n[satisfied] That's definitely going in my notebook.\n\nThe three fairies flutter back toward the chandelier as Lucy hums happily below, her rainbow compl"
