## Overview

Flutter follows two whimsical young fairies-in-training—Sparkles and Blossom—assigned to a curious and kind-hearted 4-year-old human girl named Lucy. Acting as invisible guardians, they live in Lucy's home, hidden in nooks and crannies, tasked with quietly helping her thrive. There's just one catch: they're still learning how the human world works.

Each episode centers on the fairies helping Lucy with something her mom thinks she's lost—like her toothbrush, a missing sock, or a library book. But because Sparkles and Blossom don't understand what these objects are or why they matter, they must investigate their purpose, track them down, and return them—all without being seen.

As they solve these everyday mysteries, the fairies (and viewers) discover the why behind common routines and habits. Whether it's brushing your teeth, reading before bed, or putting toys away, Flutter helps preschoolers learn the "why" behind the "what" through wonder, imagination, and a little bit of magic.

KIDDO
Found it! The magic disappearing wand!

SPARKLES bounces up from her hammock, pink wings shimmering with excitement.

SPARKLES
A disappearing wand? Let me see, let me see!

BLOSSOM adjusts her glasses, pulling out her magical notebook filled with sketches of human objects.

BLOSSOM
Hold on—where exactly did you find this?

KIDDO
Lucy's art table! She used it and POOF—her yellow crayon vanished!

From below, LUCY'S MOM's voice drifts up through the floorboards.

LUCY'S MOM (O.S.)
Lucy, honey, where did your yellow crayon go?

The three fairies flutter to their telescope (made from a paper towel tube) and peer down. Lucy sits at her art table, shoulders ... and so on...
